## General Information
-Problem Statement
Working for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
-If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
-If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

-The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

- This is being solved by using the customer data set provided.

## Conclusions
- Higher the interest rate, higher the charge off ratio.
- Higher the annual income, higher the loan amount slightly.
- Interest rate is increasing with the loan amount increase, this results in high charge off.
- We see an increase in charge off, with the increase in loan tenure.
- Higher percentage of loan amount is recovered when annual income is high.
